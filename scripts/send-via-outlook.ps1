.SYNOPSIS
    Open the hrs-ai notification as a pre-filled Outlook compose window.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads .ai/<ISSUE>/email_draft.md (produced by `hrs-ai notify <ISSUE>`) and
    creates a new Outlook mail item with the subject, body, and recipient filled
    in. By default it opens the compose window for you to review and click Send.

    This uses your installed Outlook desktop client, which sends over its own
    modern-auth channel (HTTPS) — so it works even when the tenant disables SMTP
    client authentication and when outbound port 25 is blocked. Company data
    stays inside Outlook / Microsoft 365.

.PARAMETER Issue
    The Jira issue key, e.g. HR-12345.

.PARAMETER To
    Recipient address. Defaults to $env:HRS_AI_EMAIL_TO, then your own mailbox.

.PARAMETER Send
    Send immediately instead of opening the compose window for review.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\send-via-outlook.ps1 HR-12345
    # Opens Outlook with the notification ready; review and click Send.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\send-via-outlook.ps1 HR-12345 -To lead@geosoftware.com -Send
